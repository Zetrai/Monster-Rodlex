Component LifeCycle: 
Constructor -> Render -> componentDidMount

Strict mode calls the componentDidMount twice but for developement purposes.

Opimization:
    Dont write functions inside render. Instead initialize function and assign it a variable and use that variable to call that 
    function inside render
    Destructuring the state. Assign different variables to different keys in state.
