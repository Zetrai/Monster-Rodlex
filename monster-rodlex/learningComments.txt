Component LifeCycle: 
Constructor -> Render -> componentDidMount

Strict mode calls the componentDidMount twice but for developement purposes.

Opimization:
    Dont write functions inside render. Instead initialize function and assign it a variable and use that variable to call that 
    function inside render
    Destructuring the state. Assign different variables to different keys in state.

Components should return only one parental html tag and inside that tag, we can have all the html 
Component are re-rendered when props are changed

Destructure objects if its value is used multiple times
